## SRIG-KGRR

I organize a Special Research Interest Group in Graph-based Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (SRIG-KGRR).

Our goal is to develop the next-generation graph reasoning system for the open-world model.

We define tasks, investigate theories, propose methods, and build software. Our research is partially funded by RGC of Hong Kong.

If you share a similar interest with us, feel free to send me an email.
