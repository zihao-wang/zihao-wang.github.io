My name is Zihao Wang, a master student in Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University (expected to graduate at 2020).
I am not a traditional CS guy, my undergraduate background comes form mathematics and mechanics.

- **2017.09 - Now** M. Phil, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University
- **2014.09 - 2018.06** B. Sc., Department of Mathematical Science, Tsinghua University
- **2013.09 - 2017.06** B. Eng. (*magna cum laude*), Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University

My research is focused on natural language processing and generative models. Also I have many close collaborators from diverge fields such as applied math, mechanical and chemical engineering. I believe that data and models revealing the underlining rules will help people to understand the world.

Recently, I care about three things
1. (Unbalanced) optimal transport, numerical algorithm and applications in document representation, generative model and robust variational optimization.
2. Partial differential equations and its connection with deep learning to reveal the highly non-linear system (e.g. turbulence and reactive flow).
3. Wavelet analysis and its application in deep network structure compression.
